    <h1>General Rules</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>All students, faculty, and employees of the Institute are entitled to the membership of the library.</li>
        <li>The library user shall not engage in loud conversation in any part of the library; they should observe strict silence inside the library so that others are not disturbed.</li>
         <li>Users should not talk or discuss as they may disturb other Users. Reading areas are meant for individual study and research only.</li>
        <li>A user's membership privileges can be suspended on account of misbehaviour with the Library staff or for indecent manners. Maintaining discipline in the broadest sense is the motto of the library.</li>
        <li>Books removed from the shelves, if not required further, should be kept on the nearest book trolley/table. Please do not try to shelve them yourself. Please remember that a book misplaced is a book lost.</li>
        <li>The users shall not write upon, damage or mark any book belonging to the library. Marking, scratching, damaging, mutilating, stealing, library materials, or property will invite disciplinary action against the defaulters.</li>
        <li>The user shall be responsible for any damage caused by him/her to the books or any other property belonging to the library. He or she shall be required to pay the penalty imposed upon him/her by the Library Authority.</li>
        <li>Users are not allowed to carry eatables/drinks inside the library.</li>
        <li>Users should not leave bags/books/copies on the table and cannot claim, capture, and reserve seats for future use. Capturing/reserving seats for friends/future use is strictly prohibited. Other users may remove the bags and books if these are left unattended on the tables.</li>
        <li>The Library reserves the right to call back any issued book/item at any time.</li>
        <li>The users should not leave their reading material (e.g., Coaching material, Newspapers, Notes, etc.) and personal belongings on the tables unattended. If found unattended for a long-time, beyond 12 hours, it may be removed by the Library Staff/Security staff during the cleaning of tables, and the library will not be responsible for the same. The same will also be disposed-off using standard procedures.</li>
        <li>Personal Bags should be kept at Property Counter at own risk. No valuable items, e.g., Laptop, mobile, money, ATM Cards, etc. should be kept inside the bags. If kept, the Library will not be responsible for any such loss.</li>
